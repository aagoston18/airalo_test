This framework has been designed with capabilities for executing both UI and API tests. It has been generated using maven quickstart archetype.
Framework is using Selenium for UI tests and Apache HTTP Client with wrappers for API tests.
Test runner in this framework is TestNG.

Framework tooling also includes WebDriverManager for accurate driver handling and a JSON parser for handling the API responses.
See pom.xml for all other dependencies.

Requirements:
1. Maven 3.x
2. Java 11

To run tests, navigate to the project folder where the 'pom.xml' lives and type:
- 'mvn test'

Ideas for next steps:
- add Allure reporting support
- parallel test execution
- implement provider for SL4J in classnames
- multiple test suite files for better testing focus
